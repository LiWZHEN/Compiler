## lexer

Use boost::regex to get tokens, but match RawStringLiteral,
RawCStringLiteral and BlockComments manually.

## parser

Generate an AST tree (point from parent to children).

Use Pratt Parsing in the expression-with-infix parsing procedure,
and top-down parsing for the rest.

## semantic

### 1.SymbolVisitor

Create a scope tree with the symbols in their scopes separately.

The pointers between scope nodes point from child to parent,
and the pointers between AST tree and scope tree point from
AST node to scope node.

From a scope node, we can find corresponding AST node by a
symbol name in std::string type.

### 2.ValueTypeVisitor

Figure out the type that a node should have.
